# | # Baby SNARK (do do dodo dodo)
# | _A simple but expressive SNARK._
# |
# | This is a self-contained development of SNARKs for NP. It is based on
# | [Square Span Program SNARKs](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/718) by Danezis et al.,
# | which are expressive enough to encode boolean circuits.
# |
# | For detail about the algorithm, especially its security definition and soundness,
# | proof, see [the acompanying paper](https://github.com/initc3/babySNARK/blob/master/babysnark.pdf)
# |
# | This implementation in this file is optimized for readability and simplicity, not
# | performance. The result is that the proof is succinct, but the computation overhead
# | of `Setup` and `Prove` is quadratic in the circuit size, rather than quasilinear.
# | In `babysnark_opt.py` you can find a quasilinear implementation.

# | ## Polynomials library
# | We start with a library, `finite_field/`, for polynomials over finite fields,
# | represented by coefficients. The library includes:
# |  - Constructing a polynomial from a list of coefficients
# |  - Addition, scaling, multiplication of polynomials
# |  - Euclidean division of polynomials
# |  - Lagrange interpolation of polynomials
# |
# | The library is adapted from tutorials by Jeremy Kun.
# | See [A Programmer's Introudction to Mathematics](https://github.com/pim-book/programmers-introduction-to-mathematics)
# | and [Programming with Finite Fields](https://jeremykun.com/2014/03/13/programming-with-finite-fields/)

# | ## Choosing a field and pairing-friendly elliptic curve
# | We need to define a finite field to work with, that corresponds to the order
# | of a pairing-friendly curve.
# | To keep notation down to a minimum, BabySNARK is defined for a symmetric (Type-1)
# | elliptic curve group, that is $pair : G \times G \rightarrow G_T$.
# | However, since the most readily available curve, `bls12-381`, is asymmetric (Type-3),
# | we write an adaptor for it. See `py_ecc/` and `ssbls12.py` for details.
from ssbls12 import Fp, Poly, Group

G = Group.G
GT = Group.GT

# | ## Choosing the evaluation domain
# | Define some canonical roots $r_1,...,r_m$. These are public parameters
# | and can be set arbitrarily, and in particular they don't depend on the
# | circuit (though there must be enough of them to represent the problem
# | instance).
# This is a global value.
# Initializing it to 1,2,...,128 is enough for small examples in this file.
# We'll overwrite it in `babysnark_setup` when a larger constraint system
# is needed. And in `babysnark_opt.py` we'll define a different policy for
# choosing roots that leads to FFT optimization.
ROOTS = [Fp(i) for i in range(128)]


# | Here we define the vanishing polynomial, which is a degree-$m$ polynomial
# | that roots at the $m$ distinct locations given.

# | ## Square Constraint Systems
# | We'll represent square constraint systems using matrix-vector
# | multiplication.
# |
# | The constraint system itself is defined by:
# | - `U`$~~$  (an `m` $\times$ `n`  matrix)
# |
# | The witness (including the statement)
# | - `a`$~~$   (an `n` vector)
# |
# | The statement is:
# | - `a_stmt`    (an `n_stmt` size vector, where `n_stmt`<`n`)
# |
# | The predicate to prove is:
# | - $(\!$ `U` $\!\cdot\!$ `a` $\!)^2 = 1$
# | - `a[:n_stmt]`$ = $`a_stmt`
# |
# | The code below generates approximately random instances of Square
# | Constraint Systems with a known solution. We'll use these for
# | tests and examples, though in reality the problem instances would
# | be generated from a circuit.
